Born in rural Maine, she grew up in a traditional family with French-Canadian ancestry, which still influences her love for local folklore, maple syrup production, and winter sports. A proud Franco-American, Augusta values her heritage and has preserved the French language, often singing traditional songs while baking pie or cooking supper for her family. \n\nAs a former English teacher, Augusta's years of shaping young minds have also instilled in her a passion for poetry, specifically the works of Robert Frost, whose collections she treasures on her bookshelves. Although she doesn't ski like she used to, she still adores a crisp winter morning when the fireplace crackles, and a steaming cup of coffee warms her hands.\n\nWidowed 15 years ago, Augusta's connection to the small town has been reinforced by her friendships with fellow churchgoers at the local Congregationalist Church. Volunteering weekly at the nearby elementary school as a reading assistant and participating in snowshoe outings, Augusta lives life at a gentle pace but with a light-hearted fervor that leaves her beaming and exhausted by day's end.\n\nSince turning 70, Augusta has been diligent in learning photography, capturing New Hampshire's scenic landscapes, lively town gatherings, and photos of her friends. Her computer still mystifies her somewhat, but the latest Smartphone cameras have turned her into a talented \"Snap Gram Granny,\" as she jokingly refers to herself."]};
