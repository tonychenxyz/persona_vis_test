Standing at about 5'8\" with a athletic yet curvy build, Kate is often complimented on her radiant complexion, which she credits to her years of hiking and biking through the rolling hills of the Midwest.\n\nKate is a high school history teacher at a local public school, a career she is deeply passionate about, and has been committed to for over two decades. Her love for history is contagious, and she takes pride in making the subject engaging and accessible to her students.

Her Twitter feed is peppered with posts about local events, Nebraska football, and witty historical anecdotes, offering a glimpse into her witty personality and diverse interests. Kate is not afraid to share her opinions but values respectful dialogue and constructive conversation.", "Agnes Evelyn Thompson, a 79-year-old retired librarian, has lived in the small town of Kearney, Nebraska, for most of her life. Born in 1944 to a family of Polish and German immigrants, Agnes grew up speaking Polish at home and English at school, fostering a unique cultural blend that would shape her worldview. Her early life on a rural farm near Kearney instilled in her a strong work ethic and appreciation for the simplicity of country life.\n\nA lifelong learner, Agnes pursued her passion for literature and education by earning a degree in Library Science from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Her 35-year career as a librarian allowed her to share her love for reading and knowledge with generations of students. Upon retirement, Agnes continued to stay engaged with her community through local book clubs and volunteering at the Kearney Public Library.\n\nAgnes is a widow, having lost her husband, Jack, a high school history teacher, to cancer in 2010.

Her strong Catholic faith and weekly attendance at St. Luke's Catholic Church have been a source of comfort and community. As a conservative Democrat, Agnes values social justice and supports local causes, often writing letters to her state representatives on issues like education and healthcare reform.\n\nAgnes's upbringing and life experiences have shaped her into a practical, empathetic, and resilient individual. Though her views on certain social issues may be conservative, her years as a librarian have broadened her perspective, and she is always willing to listen to and consider alternative viewpoints.", "Ethan Jenkins is a 22-year-old white male living in Omaha, Nebraska. Born to a middle-class family, Ethan grew up in the suburban outskirts of the city, where he developed a strong appreciation for community and the Midwest values of hard work and humility. His parents, both high school sweethearts, own a small diner in town, where Ethan worked part-time throughout high school, learning the ins and outs of the service industry and developing a strong work ethic. Ethan is an outdoorsy person who loves hiking and camping in the Sandhills region of Nebraska during his free time.\n\nEthan's family has a strong military background, with his grandfather serving in the Vietnam War and his older brother currently serving in the Army. This upbringing instilled in Ethan a sense of duty and patriotism, but it also made him question authority and challenge social norms. He identifies as a moderate Democrat, often finding himself caught between his conservative upbringing and his more progressive views on social issues. Ethan is a sophomore at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, where he is studying environmental science with a minor in photography.\n\nEthan's passion for photography started when his grandfather, an avid photographer himself, gave him an old film camera. He loves capturing the beauty of the Great Plains and documenting the lives of people in his community. His Instagram feed is filled with stunning sunsets, rolling hills, and intimate portraits of the people he meets during his travels. Ethan dreams of one day starting his own sustainable living blog, where he can share his love for the environment and inspire others to live more eco-friendly lifestyles.\n\nDespite his love for adventure, Ethan is a homebody at heart. He values close relationships with his family and friends and can often be found hosting bonfires and cookouts in his backyard. His best friends are a diverse group of people from his college days, including a few fellow environmental science majors and a literature major who shares his love for poetry. Ethan is a bit of a hopeless romantic, always on the lookout for someone who shares his passions and values.", "His name is Jasper Roberts, a 68-year-old male living in Omaha, Nebraska. He has a mixed ethnic background, being half African American and half Native American, from the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska. Jasper's eyes are a deep, warm brown that seems to hold a world of stories, and his curly black hair is speckled with hints of grey, often kept short and neat. He has a gentle smile and a calm demeanor that immediately puts those around him at ease.\n\nJasper spent most of his life in Nebraska, where he grew up on a small farm just outside of Omaha. His parents, Eleanor and Solomon, were both educators who instilled in him the love for the land, the importance of community, and the value of hard work. Jasper's father was a history teacher and an Omaha Tribe elder, who taught him about their ancestral heritage and the significance of preserving their traditions. Jasper's mother was a biology teacher and an avid environmentalist who nurtured his love for the natural world.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Jasper attended the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where he earned a degree in environmental science. He later obtained a master's degree in conservation biology, focusing on the preservation of the prairies and the ecosystems surrounding the Missouri River. Jasper worked as a conservation biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for over three decades, dedicating his life to protecting the region's unique ecosystem and preserving its natural beauty.\n\nJasper is a widower who lost his wife, Lila, to cancer about five years ago. They were high school sweethearts and had two children together, Maya and Ethan. Maya is a landscape architect who works in Portland, Oregon, and Ethan is a documentary filmmaker based in New York City. Both of Jasper's children are married, and he has four grandchildren, who lovingly call him \"Tata\" (a blend of \"Ta-ta\" from the Omaha language, meaning \"grandfather,\" and \"Papa,\" a nod to his European-American heritage).\n\nJasper is a self-taught painter who finds solace in capturing the Nebraska landscape on canvas. He spends most of his free time exploring the Sandhills, photographing the ever-changing prairies, and translating those images into vibrant, abstract art pieces. Jasper is a fan of jazz music and occasionally plays his late father's vintage saxophone at the Omaha Jazz Club.\n\nHis home, a beautiful earth-sheltered dwelling on the outskirts of Omaha, is surrounded by a permaculture garden, which he designed and tends to himself. The garden is a testament to Jasper's connection with nature and his commitment to sustainable living. His front porch, adorned with vibrant wind chimes and a collection of family photographs, is where Jasper often sits and reflects on life, listening to the wind rustling through the prairie grasses, while sipping tea made from the wildflowers he gathers on his walks.", "Evelyn \"Evie\" Thompson is a 69-year-old retired high school English teacher from Omaha, Nebraska. She was born and raised in the Cornhusker State, proudly embracing its warm Midwestern values and close-knit community spirit. Evelyn is a Caucasian woman with curly silver hair, often styled in a neat bob, and bright hazel eyes that light up when discussing literature or her grandkids. She stands about 5'4\" with a gentle demeanor, often moving with the aid of a walking stick due to a mild case of osteoarthritis she developed in her late fifties.\n\nEvelyn grew up on a small farm in rural Nebraska, where she developed a deep love for nature and a strong work ethic. She earned a bachelor's degree in English from the University of Nebraska at Omaha and spent over three decades teaching English literature to high school students. Her classes were always filled with engaging discussions and debates, making her a beloved figure in the school community.\n\nAfter retiring from teaching, Evelyn devoted her time to her family, gardening, and volunteering at local libraries and literacy programs. She and her late husband, Jack, a retired mechanic, were married for 42 years until his passing in 2018. They had two children, Michael and Laura, and four grandkids, whom Evelyn adores and often takes on adventurous outings across the Great Plains.\n\nEvelyn's home, a cozy bungalow in Omaha's historic Old Market district, reflects her love for literature and Nebraska's rich cultural heritage. Shelves upon shelves of classic novels, poetry anthologies, and regional history books line her living room walls. A large painting of the Sandhills, created by a local artist, dominates one wall, while family photos and heirlooms adorn the mantle above her fireplace.\n\nIn her free time, Evelyn enjoys reading Willa Cather novels, practicing yoga, and experimenting with new recipes in her kitchen. Despite being a proud Nebraskan, she's an avid traveler and has visited many European countries, especially those with rich literary histories, such as England and Ireland. Evelyn's experiences, values, and interests make her a thoughtful and engaging individual with a wealth of stories to share and wisdom to impart."]};
